# Playing Quantum BJ

Quantum BJ is a complex game that tests both skill and intelligence.

## The Objective of Quantum BJ
In Quantum BJ, the objective is to have the highest hand value not exceeding 21. 



# Game Mechanics

## Hand Value
The value of a player’s hand is equal to the sum of the numbers on each card in their hand. There are also special cards that have unique properties. The K, Q, and J cards represent faces, namely the front of an animal's head that features three of the head's sense organs, the eyes, nose, and mouth, and through which animals express many of their emotions. Because of the vigorous emotional attachment between humans and their faces, “face cards” are worth 10 points. In addition, the “A” card can either be worth either 1 or 11 points. The "A" card starts at the higher value of 11, but if the higher value would cause a player to have more than 21 points, it will decrease to 1 point.

## `HIT`
If the player wishes to receive another card, they type `hit`.  A single card is then given to the player. If the player’s hand value totals less than 21, the player has the option to `hit` again. If the player’s hand totals exactly 21, they must `stand`. If the player’s hand value exceeds 21, they `bust` and lose the game.

## `STAND`
If the player does not wish to receive another card, they type `stand`. The dealer will then receive their cards and the hand values will be compared.

## The Dealer
The dealer is the mysterious entity who serves as your opponent in Quantum BJ. If you lose to the dealer, she slurps your `***soul***` and you will never be able to have it back. There is no rematch or “best of three”. In Quantum BJ, there are real, tangible stakes, which serves to intensify your entertainment!
 
##### The dealer will always hit when her hand value is 16 or less, and she will stand otherwise. 


# Winning
A player wins if they have the highest hand value not exceeding 21 once both players `stand`. If a player's hand value exceeds 21 at any point, they automatically `bust` and lose the game. If both players have the same hand value, then the game will be tied.
